3. openness in regards of your goals and values

### This Roadmap displays only some of topics that we are planning to work on in 2020 – we welcome feedback and research questions

* January
  * start with some testing. internally at the beginning. we aim to launch a collective test.
  * the first goal is test ourselves. how the communication works, review cycle, public reception
  * test the platform and use it for data analysis.

* February, March
  * repeat tests and develop some research insights.
  * mentorship or inclusion of new people.
  * do calls more often.
  * consolidate [mattermost channel](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed).
  * use github issues and documentation more often
  * evaluate poalto repetition + we might have ideas from the new partners to engage with

* April
  * summarize this phase 1 research findings
  * if the test approach went well (collective direction)
  * and/or if the internal research produces results (experience in algorithm accountability)
  * we'll have figure out better which direction the platform take

### Work in progress

* Compare section will show categories from /recommended (this means: support the new metadata.type, implement new API and new viz)
* Compare section will confront different suggestions for the same video (if the changes happen by time, and not by personalization, we should add a timeseries graph?)
* Data Voyeuring will be divided into sessions or x days (the pagination might be reviewed)
* Improve interface and data viz aesthetic
* Try to underline the Hot Videos ;)
* Fix the [impact](/impact)
