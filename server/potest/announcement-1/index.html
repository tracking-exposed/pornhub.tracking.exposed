Videos of the past, unlikely changes their related content, and entirely become tight to their selected eight, after a while.

<li>htmls (raw htmls received by browser extension)</li>
<li>metadata (the actual parsed information):
<ul>
<li>metadata of type &lsquo;video&rsquo; have tags, categories and the 8 related content</li>
<li>metadata type &lsquo;home&rsquo; have the five sections and the video display</li>
<li>metadata type &lsquo;recommented&rsquo; has a sequence of videos recomended by pornhub guesses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross entries count (which might also be collected when the test was over, and we have to decide if consider them or not):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; db.getCollection('htmls').count({href: &quot;https://www.pornhub.com/&quot;, savingTime: { $gte: new Date(&quot;2020-01-19&quot;) }})
1027

1031
</code></pre><p>The html saved are heavily duplicated: an observation might send up to 5 time the same html, which will contribute to the same metadataId. This is why we&rsquo;ve to look at the unique number of publicKey (which is the user identifier)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>db.getCollection('htmls').distinct('publicKey', {href: &quot;https://www.pornhub.com/recommended&quot;, savingTime: { $gte: new Date(&quot;2020-01-19&quot;) }})
</code></pre><p>89 elements. Maybe not all the participants followed the script correctly, and perhaps our parser did not work in all the possible scenarios, but as a generic indication, we gathered 89 individual observations in our first test.</p>
<p>Is it bad or good? It is, of course, good news. It is representative? Of course it isn&rsquo;t. Thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t matter yet since our first goal is to test out team, the tool, and start to measure the divergence between similar PH experiences.</p>
<h2 id="update-n3----21-january-2020">Update n.3 &ndash; 21 January 2020</h2>
<p>The <em>recommended</em> parser is supported now! each video suggested will be extracted with the following dataformat:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>   {

<p>&hellip;In regards of the Chrome extension, it seems definitely blocked at the moment:</p>

<p>Despite Google didn&rsquo;t enable our extention, a bunch of Firefox adopters supported our project:</p>

<p>This test will work only with our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adult-industry-algorithms/">firefox extension</a>, because Google has put our extension under <em>revision</em>, and therefore it is not accessible to the public:</p>

<h2 id="announcement-----19-january-2020">Announcement  &ndash; 19 January 2020</h2>
<p>On Sunday, January 19th, 2020: join the first collective observation of the #pornhub algorithm!</p>
<p>We are the tracking.exposed team and our main objective is to put a spotlight on users’ tracking, profiling, and the wider data market by performing an open algorithmic analysis. We believe that, as long as the operation of recommendation systems remains obscure, the many side-effects of platform economy cannot be tackled as they should.</p>
<p>After the development of the infrastructure and analysis tools facebook.tracking.exposed and youtube.tracking.exposed, we decided to take inspiration from the 34th rule of the internet: There is porn of it. No exceptions.</p>
<p>So, are now also focusing on online porn giant PornHub, trying to unpack the hidden logic of user profiling!</p>
<p>We do it because personalization algorithms have the potential to shape public perception, and Pornhub claims to implement some kind of personalization!</p>
<p>To do this, we need your help! Join our global test and explore for yourself how the Pornhub experience varies between users that are performing the same actions. You have to follow an 8 step script. (hard work for a Sunday!)
After the test is completed and the evidence analyzed, we will release the dataset, along with some research and a final report, around January 30th, 2020.</p>
<p>You can find our browser extension on the pornhub.tracking.exposed website: it is necessary to participate, and collects what Pornhub send to you. Partecipation is anonymous, the extension can be used in Incognito/Private mode if you allow it, and for extra safety, you can even do the test with a browser you normally do not use (the extension runs in both Firefox and Chrome).</p>
<p>The test is simple — just follow the script you&rsquo;ll find at this address: <a href="https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/1">https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/1</a>. All you have to do is to click on a few links, and we&rsquo;ll do the rest: by comparing multiple observations coming from our participants, we&rsquo;ll measure how frequently personalized changes happen.</p>
<p>The test is not safe for work! We kindly ask you to watch the two videos that we selected after months of exhausting research, but if you don&rsquo;t like them, don&rsquo;t worry! Twenty seconds are enough for the extension to collect data and send it back to us. Of course, you retain full control of the evidence you send to us: by clicking on the extension icon, you can open your personal page, where you can eventually delete everything you sent us or play with our basic data analysis functionality.</p>
<p>Thank you,
The pornhub.tracking.exposed team</p>
